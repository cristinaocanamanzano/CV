## About me

I am an enthusiastic and engaged web development student. Currently looking for a position where I can bring value and contribute to the company's success while learning new technologies and improving my existing knowledge about them.

With a translation background, and after more than 3 years working in the operations team at Lingoda, a startup based in Germany, I decided to make a change in my career and decided to become a web developer. 

With that goal in mind, I joined Makers through the fellowship program in September. During this bootcamp, we learnt different languages and frameworks:Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, HTML and CSS, etc.

We also did several group projects, which was a great opportunity to gain experience collaborating in a team, putting in practice an Agile approach and XP values, learning about continuous integration, etc.

## Skills

#### Attention to detail

Studying and working as a translator made me become a very detailed-oriented person from a very early stage in my life. 

After this, dealing with customer requests and a not-so-easy-to-understand platform and database during my three years working in Lingoda made my attention skills improve even more. In addition to this, I also had to build and run reports on a weekly basis, which allowed me to develop these skills even more. 


#### Analytical and data-driven thinker 

Working in a startup for more than 3 years has taught me the importance of obtaining relevant data and analyzing relevant scenarios and situations before taking any decisions that can affect the whole company.

During my time in Lingoda, I had the opportunity to learn how to collect data from the database using SQL and to combine it with the input from the customers. This allowed me to draft and suggest different alternatives and solutions for different purposes: improve the implementation of the promotions, optimize the functionalities of the learning platform, establish new email flows or improve the existing ones, etc.

#### Solution oriented

Working within the Operations Team in Lingoda has shaped my mind and behaviour patterns in such a way I have become quite effective at finding and suggesting solutions to complicated situations and issues. This has not only affect me from a professional point of view, but also from a personal one. Thanks to my time in this company, now I always try to analyze every possible alternative to solve any problem instead of being stuck thinking "we should have done this differently".

Some of the situations that I found a solution for were, for example: 
• Finding a software that distributes request tickets automatically among the agents (which translated into a huge amount of time saved since we were doing this manually before)
• Building a remote team of agents located in different timezones to cover the shifts outside of our office hours
