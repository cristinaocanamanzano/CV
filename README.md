## Cristina María Ocaña Manzano

With a translation background, and after more than three years working in a startup in Germany, first as a customer service representative and then as a customer service team lead, I decided to make a change in my life and took the hard but right decision of going after a challenge. After something where I can make full use of my skills and still do something that I really love and enjoy. After something where I can implement new ideas based on decisions guided throuhg logical thinking, solve complicated puzzles, be involved in an innovative environment... To sum up, I decided to become a developer.

From September on, I'll be studying full-time to become a developer in Makers Academy, a programming bootcamp based in London. This program will last 12 weeks. 

During th is period, my goal will be to learn as much as I can about programming and develop the required skills to be able to find a job in a field relayed to something that I like. My dream is to work in computational linguistcs since this combines what I love the most: languages and new technologies. 

## Skills

#### Attention to detail

Studying and working as a translator made me become a very detailed-oriented person from a very early stage in my life. 

After this, dealing with customer requests and a not-so-easy-to-understand platform and database during my three years working in Lingoda made my attention skills improve even more. In addition to this, I also had to build and run reports on a weekly basis, which allowed me to develop these skills even more. 


#### Analytical and data-driven thinker 

Working in a startup for more than 3 years has taught me the importance of obtaining relevant data and analyzing relevant scenarios and situations before taking any decisions that can affect the whole company.

During my time in Lingoda, I had the opportunity to learn how to collect data from the database using SQL and to combine it with the input from the customers. This allowed me to draft and suggest different alternatives and solutions for different purposes: improve the implementation of the promotions, optimize the functionalities of the learning platform, establish new email flows or improve the existing ones, etc.

#### Solution oriented

Working within the Operations Team in Lingoda has shaped my mind and behaviour patterns in such a way I have become quite effective at finding and suggesting solutions to complicated situations and issues. This has not only affect me from a professional point of view, but also from a personal one. Thanks to my time in this company, now I always try to analyze every possible alternative to solve any problem instead of being stuck thinking "we should have done this differently".

Some of the situations that I found a solution for were, for example, finding a software that distributes request tickets automatically among the agents (which translated into a huge amount of time saved since we were doing this manually before), building a remote team of agents located in different timezones to cover the shifts outside of our office hours, etc.
